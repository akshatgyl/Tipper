## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My only source of knowledge about swift came from talking to apple engineers at hackathons and a few online video tutorials. So I had to learn most of the functions required by this app. I always look for opportunities to learn from and this project has been a great one. I hope I am given to the chance to learn more!
